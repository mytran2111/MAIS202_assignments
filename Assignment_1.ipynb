Specifically, we will be solidifying your knowledge of linear regression, gradient descent, training-validation-testing split, overfitting/underfitting, and L2 regularization, we will also briefly look at the concept of hyperparameter search. While you will likely never have to implement your own linear regression algorithm from scratch in practice, doing so will help you better understand the underlying mathematics behind the concepts.\n",
